Ludum Dare 26 Game
==================

This is a game that I am making for Ludum Dare 26.
It is written in C++, using OpenGL with SDL, and SDL_mixer for sound.


Compilation
===========
You will have to have valid installs of SDL and SDL_mixer( see http://lazyfoo.net ), and
to have Code::Blocks installed and configured.

You need to link against the following libraries:
SDL, SDL_mixer, GL, GLU

You will also need to add <folder you downloaded to>/include/ to the Search Directories.
